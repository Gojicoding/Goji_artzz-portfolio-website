                     <p style="text-align:center; background-color:MediumSeaGreen; text-color:white; border-color:white; ">Hello! My names Eugene Hardimon Jr. But you MAY know me as Goji_artzz, or UNKNOWN GOJIRA. I am currently 16 years old and I am attending olive harvey middle college. I am also attending its dual enrollment classes. So I get to learn in a college setting and get college credits in things that I want to learn. With that being said, you may wonder what are my interests? What do I want to do in life? Well its quite a bit. I am interested in art and programming/coding. When i was about 11, i fell in love with game development and computer programming, and ive always been drawing and crafting things since I was old enough to remember! Specifically what I like to do nowadays artwise is character designing for my small stories. I also find an interest in 3d modeling and animation. But for now, the only thing out of those 2 that will be displayed alongside art is the 3d models ive made.</p>

                     <h2 style= "text-align:center; background-color:MediumSeaGreen; text-color:white; border-color:white;"> <b>Skills</b> </h2>
              <p style= "text-align:center; background-color:MediumSeaGreen; text-color:white; border-color:white; text-size:100px"> My skills consist of being an skilled level story writer who can write fun, enjoyable stories with likable characters and good development, a skilled character designer who can create characters accurately based on their personality and demeanor to better convey who they are, and what their role is in the story. I can also program websites, tho id say im still either intermediate or novice level when it comes to this. But with time, comes progress. I can also create beautiful digital art work to convey an idea and title it appropriately.</p>
